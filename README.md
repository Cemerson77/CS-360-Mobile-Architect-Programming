### App Development Summary

### Requirements and Goals:

The FitTrack app was envisioned to empower users in their pursuit of a healthier lifestyle. It aimed to fulfill the user's desire for an intuitive platform to seamlessly record and monitor their weight, set personal goals, and receive motivational SMS notifications.

### Key Screens and Features:

1.	**Login and Account Creation:** Users can create accounts and log in to the app.
2.	**Weight Tracking:** Users can log and monitor their weight records. They can create, update, and delete records.
3.	**BMI Calculator:** An integrated BMI calculator helps users understand their body mass index.
4.	**Goal Weight:** Users can set and track their goal weight to stay motivated.

### User-Centered Design:
The UI designs were centered around the user experience, prioritizing simplicity and usability. Clear and intuitive interfaces were implemented to ensure easy access and management of weight data. The success of the designs can be attributed to their user-centric approach, focusing on core user needs without unnecessary complexity.

### Coding Approach:
The app was developed using Android Studio and Java. Techniques included modularization, adherence to Android best practices, and version control with Git. These techniques can be applied in the future by maintaining clean and organized code, staying updated with Android development guidelines, and continuing to use version control for effective collaboration.

### Testing Process:
The code was rigorously tested using the Android Emulator and simulated user interactions. Testing is crucial to identify and resolve issues, ensure the app behaves as expected, and provide a smooth user experience. It revealed the functionality and usability of the app, and any bugs or inconsistencies were addressed.

### Innovation and Challenges:
Innovation was required when implementing the SMS notification feature, especially in handling user responses when permissions are denied. Creative problem-solving was necessary to ensure the app continued to function seamlessly without the SMS notification feature.

### Success in UI and Database:
I demonstrated strong knowledge and skills in user interface design and database integration. The user-centered UI design was intuitive, and the database component efficiently allowed users to create, update, and view weight records.
